# S3 for Leaf FS

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/leafs/s3/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/leafs/s3)
[![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/leafs/s3/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/leafs/s3)
[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/leafs/s3/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/leafs/s3)

A drop-in extension for [Leaf FS](https://github.com/leafs/fs) that allows you to use S3 as a storage driver for Leaf FS.

## Installation

You can easily install Leaf using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require leafs/s3
```

## Leaf MVC

If you are using Leaf MVC, add your S3 URL to the `.env` file:

```env
S3_URL=https://your-s3-url
```

## Leaf without MVC

If you are using Leaf without MVC, you can set the S3 URL in your code:

```php
storage()->bucket('your-s3-url');
```

## Usage

From there, you can use the s3 bucket as you would with your local storage, only wrapping your storage path in the `withBucket()` method to switch to bucket storage. For example, to upload a file:

```php
storage()->upload('path/to/file.txt', withBucket('path/in/s3'));

// or directly from the request
request()->upload('file', withBucket('path/in/s3'));
```
